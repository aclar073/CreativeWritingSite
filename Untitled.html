                    <h2><strong>Untitled</strong></h2>
                    <h5>Written by Amanda Clark</h5>
                </div>

                <p>During the day, the house is quite
                    unassuming. The shutters hang haphazardly from the darkened windows. The porch
                    sags in the middle as if tired of remaining upright. There is paint peeling
                    from every exterior surface. Neighbors passed by without a second glance at the
                    overgrown yard riddled with weeds, thankful that their properties appeared
                    nicer by comparison. Children played ball in the cul-de-sac but never ventured
                    particularly close to the seemingly abandoned home. During the day, the house,
                    as unsightly as it was, simply blended into the suburban scenery. </p>

                <p>When adults were out of earshot,
                    the children often joked that the house was haunted. They had been scolded
                    enough by their parents and learned quickly to say such things no louder than a
                    whisper. They spoke of strange shadows in the windows after dark and inhuman
                    noises emanating from the upper portion of the home. The adults noticed this as
                    well but did not dare admit it. </p>

                <p>Mr. Jones had lived in the house
                    for as long as he could remember. His memory was questionable these days at the
                    age of eighty-five, but he did remember running the halls as a child. His
                    mother would scold him for running in the house. Now he struggled to shuffle with
                    his walker and maintained a slow but steady pace. This would have pleased his
                    mother. He wished she was here to see him. </p>

                <p>She left him the house in her will.
                    He assumed she intended him to raise his own children here, but Mr. Jones had
                    never married. He had no interest in a relationship and found children to be
                    quite annoying. Their loud shrieks used to express a variety of emotions left
                    his ears ringing even as a younger man. He was content with his life of
                    solitude. He found it comforting not having to answer another person and having
                    the freedom to do as he pleases. He seldom left his home during the day and the
                    neighbors had seen very little of him. Even less as time has passed, his
                    previously sinewy frame atrophied and skeletal. </p>

                <p>The only person he saw regularly
                    was Mrs. Wilson. She was his home health nurse and came weekly. He assumed it
                    was to make sure he hadn’t died but did not verbalize this assumption. Her
                    feelings would surely be hurt, and he did not like it when she felt strongly
                    about much of anything. </p>

                <p>When the doorbell rang Mr. Jones
                    was quite surprised. Mrs. Wilson’s schedule was like clockwork. She showed up
                    at 1 pm, no sooner and no later. It was a quarter past 9 am and Mrs. Wilson was
                    not due for another two days. He was not expecting a visitor and pondered if one
                    of the children worked up the nerve to ring the bell and run away. Lost in
                    thought, Mr. Jones jumped at the sound of the doorbell ringing yet again. At
                    this point he was annoyed by this intrusion into his normally peaceful Monday
                    morning. </p>

                <p>He slowly shuffled his way towards
                    the front door and the doorbell rang for a third time. He grunted as the tire
                    of his walker caught on the table of the foyer. He cautiously pulled it
                    backwards and stumbled as it unstuck. He caught himself against the wall and
                    felt the vast number of framed pictures rattle at the impact. As he finally
                    reached the door, he found his legs to be weak at the exertion of maneuvering
                    from the kitchen. </p>

                <p>He opened the door and did not see
                    Mrs. Wilson, or the previously expected empty doorstep caused by an unrulily
                    child. Instead, he saw a man he did not recognize. His eyebrows knit together
                    in confusion and concern as he inspected this uninvited stranger at his door. </p>

                <p>This stranger was indeed strange. He
                    carried a battered leather briefcase that looked as if it were new sometime in
                    the 1950’s. In fact, everything about this man appeared to come from the
                    1950’s. He wore a pair of charcoal gray high waisted trousers, a white dress
                    shirt, and a matching charcoal gray topcoat. His light brown hair was parted to
                    the side and held in place with some form of gel. To Mr. Jones, it appeared as
                    if this man stepped out of the past and landed on his front porch. As he
                    performed his visual inspection of the stranger, he was meet with the confident
                    grin of a businessman. </p>

                <p>Mr. Jones did not like this man and
                    wished he would leave. </p>

                <p>“What are you trying to sell me?”
                    Mr. Jones asked curtly, hoping his disapproval was evident in his gravelly
                    voice. </p>

                <p>“Why, Mr. Jones, I am not trying to
                    see you anything. I have a proposal for you, free of charge, I think you may
                    appreciate.” </p>

                <p><i>How does this kook know my name?</i>
                    Mr. Jones thought to himself. He was caught off guard by this and simply
                    grunted at the man. He considered closing the door and ending the conversation
                    then. </p>

                <h3 class="title">About the Story</h3>
                <p>This is an incomplete work of fiction. I had no particular inspiration or intentions
                    with this story. The only thing on my mind when writing this piece was a creepy old house. 
                    I hope to finish the story when I have more of a concrete direction for the plot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think this piece has a lot of potential. I enjoyed using sensory description to paint
                    the picture of a decaying and neglected home. I also used this piece as an attempt at writing
                    in the third-person omniscient point-of-view.
