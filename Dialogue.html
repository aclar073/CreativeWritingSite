                <h4>Advice</h4>
                <p>1. Make it concise. The fewer words used to make a point, the better. Go back and cut, cut, cut—to
                    the bone—keeping only those lines that convey character and thus entertain.</p>
                <p>2. Include subtext. What people say and what they really mean are often different things, with
                    meaning often buried under the lines, and not floating on them.</p>
                <p>3. Be illogical. People are, especially when they speak—especially when they argue. For this reason
                    dialogue shouldn't always make sense. Nor do people listen when others speak; even if they do, they
                    often don't respond directly to what's just been said. When writing dialogue, try, every three or
                    four lines at least, to deal from the bottom of the deck, to have characters say something
                    surprising if not bizarre, something at least not obvious.</p>

                    <p><em>"It will be two nights hon. Time will fly by, and we'll be on our way back home before you
                            know
                            it." Richard said lightly, stroking her back. She curled against his neck, her tangled brown
                            curls hiding her wet eyes.</em></p>

                    <p><em>“Your mom seemed excited to meet the kids.” He added softly. Jamie grunted in reply but said
                            nothing.</em></p>

                    <p><em> "Come to bed. You'll feel worse if you're running on no sleep." He said giving her a tight
                            squeeze around the shoulders. She nodded and let him lead her upstairs.</em></p>

                            Mr. Jones asked curtly, hoping his disapproval was evident in his gravelly

                    <p><em>How does this kook know my name?</em></p>
                    <p><em>Mr. Jones thought to himself. He was caught off guard by this and simply
                            grunted at the man. He considered closing the door and ending the conversation
                            then. </em></p>
