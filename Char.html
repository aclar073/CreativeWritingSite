            <h4>Advice</h4>
            <p>Controlling character likability is very important, as it ensures you are writing diverse characters and
                conveying conflicting forces.


                One way to manipulate likability is through narrative distance, the proximity between characters and
                readers. Much like a camera, you can zoom into a character's point of view to create closeness between
                characters (subjects) and readers (viewers), or you can zoom out to create distance.

                Just as adjusting the camera's focus allows you to change the physical distance between the subject and
                the viewer, adjusting the narrative's focus allows you to change the emotional and psychological
                distances between the character and the reader.</p>

            <h4>Sample 1</h4>
            <blockquote class="sample">
                <p><em>Jamie was not excited about the upcoming family trip. She had spent the
                        past twelve years working odd
                        jobs to pay her tuition, meeting the man of her dreams, and advancing her career as a publicist.
                        She
                        worked hard. She was approaching a promotion. She and her husband had two beautiful little boys.
                        Life
                        was perfect and she had made it that way. The thought of returning to that home filled her with
                        dread.</em></p>

            <p>This sample text shows my attempt at creating a backstory for the main character Jamie.

            <h4>Sample 2</h4>
            <blockquote class="sample">
                <p><em></em></p>
                <p><em>Performing his daily ritual, Hugh reaches down and shuffles through the pile of unwashed clothes.
                        His
                        hand hits the hardcover of a book. He grabs the book, straightens, and lets out another yawn. He
                        doesn't have to search for the page anymore. He quickly flips past the images of his peers, many
                        of
                        them scratched out with dark black Xs. He does not miss them.</em> </p>
                <p><em>Then he sees her. Christie Halloway in her prime. She is smiling at the camera, her straight
                        blonde
                        hair blowing in the wind. She is precariously perched atop a pyramid of other girls with her
                        arms
                        held towards the sky. He remembers that night clearly, it was autumn and he had sat in the
                        stands
                        facing the cheerleaders. He was bundled in a thick winter coat. He remembers wondering if she
                        was
                        cold. Her bare legs exposed to the elements in her uniform. It left very little to the
                        imagination
                        and he quite enjoyed the view. Still, deep in the memory, Hugh absently rubs his thumb over the
                        image. He misses her dearly. </em></p>

            <p>In this story, I was attempting to make an unlikable main character. This excerpt shows his unhealthy
                obsession with a girl from high school.
