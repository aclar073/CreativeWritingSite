            <h2><strong>Home for the Holidays</strong></h2>
            <h5>Written by Amanda Clark</h5>
            </div>
        
            <p> Jamie was not excited about the upcoming family trip. She had spent the past twelve years working odd
                jobs to pay her tuition, meeting the man of her dreams, and advancing her career as a publicist. She
                worked hard. She was approaching a promotion. She and her husband had two beautiful little boys. Life
                was perfect and she had made it that way. The thought of returning to that home filled her with dread.
            </p>
            <p>Richard had planned the trip and let the boys know before she could protest. The boys were ecstatic to
                meet their grandma and grandpa. Richard tried to invoke the name of the Christmas spirit to alleviate
                her anger to no avail. She found herself wondering how this could happen. Then she thought of the
                monthly letters from her mother. Twelve years of unopened letters straight to the trash. He must have
                found one. They hadn't spoken for three days after the announcement. </p>
            <p>Now, one day from departure, she felt that sickening dread engulf her again. </p>
            <p>"It will be two nights hon. Time will fly by, and we'll be on our way back home before you know it."
                Richard said lightly, stroking her back. She curled against his neck, her tangled brown curls hiding her
                wet eyes. </p>
            <p>“Your mom seemed excited to meet the kids.” He added softly. Jamie grunted in reply but said nothing.
            </p>
            <p>"Come to bed. You'll feel worse if you're running on no sleep." He said giving her a tight squeeze around
                the shoulders. She nodded and let him lead her upstairs. </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">_____</p>
            <p>Morning came much faster than she had expected. She awoke to the loud chatter of her children downstairs
                and the smell of coffee. She felt a surge of guilt at the realization that Richard must have let her
                sleep in. He had been working late nearly every night for months to impress the senior partners and earn
                a large pay increase. If either of them deserved extra rest, it was him. </p>
            <p>Walking downstairs, she felt groggy. Without a word, she slipped into the empty barstool at the kitchen
                island next to the boys. They were so engrossed in conversation that they did not notice her. </p>
            <p>"I wonder if Santa will know where to find us," Owen said.</p>
            <p>"Of course, he will! And we'll get even more presents from Grandma and Grandpa." Cooper said with all the
                authority that can be expected from a seven-year-old big brother. </p>
            <p>"Boys," Jamie says causing them to finally realize her presence. "Your grandmother and grandfather are a
                little bit different." </p>
            <p>They look cautiously towards her, waiting for her to continue. She sighs, unsure of how to explain the
                complex topic of her family to her children. </p>
            <p>"Just try to keep an open mind and don't expect anything." </p>
            <p>The boys nod and then continue debating which presents they will receive from Santa as they make their
                way to the living room. </p>
            <p>Appreciating the new silence in the kitchen, Jamie takes a sip of the coffee Richard had placed in front
                of her and looks out the large picture window. Small flakes are falling from the dull winter sky coating
                their car in a sheet of white.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">_____</p>
                <p> By the time we arrived, the flurry of snow had become a full blizzard. When Jamie looked out the
                windshield, she struggled to see the decrepit ranch house that served as her childhood home. The kids
                were asleep in the back seat, and she felt hesitant to wake them. </p>
            <p> Richard unbuckles his seatbelt and begins to open his car door. Jamie puts her hand on his arm, and he
                pauses. </p>
            <p>"Last chance to change your mind," she says with a twinge of hope in her voice. </p>
            <p>"And miss my only chance to meet your family? They can't be that bad hon." He says smiling. She doesn't
                feel like smiling back and finds herself annoyed by his constant optimism. </p>
            <p>They both get out and each of them wakin g one of the boys. Richards carries the overnight bags. Jamie
                carries Owen towards the door and Connor follows close behind. Connor rings the doorbell, and we all
                wait. </p>
            <p>After a few minutes, the door swings wide open. Jamie is greeted by the sight of her brother. He is
                looking straight at her, and she cringes involuntarily as his mouth morphs into a smile. </p>
            <p>"Long time no see little sister," he says, his eyes boring into her.</p>
            <p>She holds his gaze but doesn't respond. </p>
            <p>"Mom is in the kitchen. She's been looking forward to meeting your boys." </p>
            <p>Still not breaking eye contact with her, he steps aside and raises one hand to gesture to them inside the
                house. </p>
            <p>Richard takes the lead and is followed by Connor. Jamie enters last, still holding a sleepy Owen in her
                arms. </p>
            <p>The house is just as she remembered. A house frozen in time filled with relics of the past. The same
                rust-orange shag carpet leads the way into the interior of the house. </p>
            <p>Jamie leads the way down the hall as her family follows behind her. The hallway is filled with pictures
                of long-gone relatives and Jamie feels as if their eyes are following her on her trek to the kitchen. As
                they walk past the closed living room door, they are greeted with a putrid odor and the sound of a
                football game on the television. Jamie keeps walking. </p>
            <p>At last, they reach the kitchen. Jamie's mother is standing with her back to the door. She is humming an
                unrecognizable tune, oblivious to their entrance.</p>
            <p>"Grandma?" Connor says. Jamie can hear a soft lilt of excitement in his voice. </p>
            <p>Jamie's mother startles and drops a large knife on the linoleum floor. The clatter of the knife causes
                Owen to stir. She quickly turns around to retrieve the knife and places it back on the cutting board on
                the counter.</p>
            <p>Seeing her mother makes Jamie's heart catch in her throat. Her previously beautiful brown curls had
                turned white with time. Her long hair was tangled into large knots which were haphazardly restrained
                into a loose bun. She wore the same light blue eyeshadow she had when Jamie was a child. </p>
            <p>Looking at the source of the interruption, Jamie’s mother nods curtly towards Connor. Then looking at her
                daughter her scarlet lips crack into a smile. Jamie notices her mother has lipstick on one of her teeth.
                Glancing down, her mother's smile slips from her face and is replaced with pure anger.</p>
            <p>"Jamie Marie! It hasn’t been that long since you’ve come home. You surely haven’t forgotten the rules.
                Are you trying to make your father ill?" She tuts. </p>
            <p>Looking down Jamie sees the cause of the offense. Her winter boots were laced tightly, and she had to set
                Owen down to remove them. </p>
            <p>With a look of concern, Richard follows her example and begins removing his shoes as well. When he is
                finished, he helps the boys with theirs. Jamie picks up all the shoes and places them on the mat in
                front of the porch door. </p>
            <p>"Sorry, Mum," Jamie says.</p>
            <p>Her mother's smile returns, and she wordlessly returns to her task at the cutting board. She began to hum
                again. </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">_____</p>
            <p>Two hours later they all sat around the dining room table. Jamie’s mother was making trips between the
                kitchen and the dining room, bringing a seemingly endless line of dishes. Jamie noted a layer of dust on
                the table. With each plate her mother bought, a small cloud of powder emanated around it. When no space
                on the table remained, her mother promptly sat down in her chair. </p>
            <p>“Ethan,” she said glancing at Jamie’s brother. “Will you do the honors?”</p>
            <p>Ethan stood up, grabbed a large carving knife from the table, and began to cut the roast beef on the
                plate nearest to him. With each cut blood oozed from the undercooked meat. Richard and the boys remained
                silent. </p>
            <p>“Where is Dad?” Jamie asked her mother. </p>
            <p>“I didn’t want to disturb him. You know how excited he gets watching his sports games.” Her mother
                replies through a mouth full of food. “I almost forgot. Would you bring him a plate?”</p>
            <p>Jamie makes him a plate in a hurry to get out of that room. Clutching the plate, she walks down the hall
                towards the living room. She is yet again met with the same putrid odor as before. She knocks on the
                door.</p>
            <p> No answer.</p>
            <p>She knocks louder this time but still receives no answer. The only sound from within the room comes from
                the television. </p>
            <p>She grips the door handle, turns it, and begins to open the door. The sound of the football game is
                nearly deafening. </p>
            <p>Opening the door farther, she stifles a scream and drops the plate. Food and ceramic pieces fly like
                shrapnel upon impact with the hard wood of the living room floor. </p>
            <p>Her father is sitting in his recliner in front of the television. His open eyes are glassy and transfixed
                towards the ceiling. What at first appeared to be a blanket covering him, comes into focus as a swarm of
                flies. They begin to buzz around the room following the disturbance with the plate. One of the flies
                landed briefly in his eye and Jamie felt her stomach turn. It was then she saw the dried blood crusted
                on his favorite jersey. His large stomach protrudes from the strained fabric . The odor is unbearable.
                She can taste the smell of decay and resists the urge to vomit. Slowly, as if detached from her body,
                she closes the door. A single tear streaks down her face and she quickly wipes it away with her sleeve.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">_____</p>
            <p>Back in the dining room, Jamie silently pushes her food around with her fork. She feels Richard place a
                reassuring hand on her leg. She can’t bring herself to respond. </p>
            <p>Ethan and her mother are discussing the severity of the storm. Her mother is speaking with manic
                excitement. The boys remain silent, listening to the conversation. Owen picks at his roll while Connor
                inspects the mac and cheese on his plate. </p>
            <p>“Jamie, you don’t feed these boys enough. They’re skin and bones!” Her mother exclaims, suddenly scooping
                more mashed potatoes onto their still-full plates. The mashed potatoes fly upwards with force causing
                both boys to jump.</p>
            <p>When dinner was done, Ethan helped his mother clear the table and start the dishes. They were finally
                alone.</p>
            <p>Jamie’s head snaps up to look at Richard. </p>
            <p>“What’s –” He began but was cut short.</p>
            <p>“We need to leave. Now. Boys get your coats on,” Jamie whispered. </p>
            <p>“What about our shoes?” Connor protested.</p>
            <p>“There’s no time.” She didn’t trust herself to say more. </p>
            <p>They crept down the hallway until they reached the front door. Taking a deep breath, Jamie pulled the
                door open. Grabbing Owen, she began to run to the car. Her socked feet stung as she ran through the
                frigid snow. She quickly buckled Owen into his car seat ignoring the stream of questions emitting from
                his mouth. She could see the confused tears welling in his eyes. Closing the car door, she looks over
                the hood of the car toward Richard. She motioned for him to come around. He looked bewildered and she
                silently thanked him for trusting her.</p>
            <p>“When I was a child, some girls went missing,” Jamie had to yell so Richard could hear her over the howl
                of wind. “They never caught who took them. But sometimes I would hear sounds in the basement. I knew it
                was Ethan. One night I heard my parents arguing about it. They confronted Ethan and the disappearances
                stopped. Mum was never the same, but I thought it was over. I was wrong. He killed my father and they’re
                acting as if he’s still alive. We need to go to the police.”</p>
            <p>Richard seemed at a loss for words and simply nodded.</p>
            <p>They both got into the car and Richard stuck the key in the ignition. When he turned it, nothing
                happened. He tried again. And again, the car did not start. Jamie felt a flutter of panic rise in her
                chest. Richard continued to turn the key one way and then the other, unwilling to accept defeat. </p>
            <p>They were all startled by a knock on the window. Jamie and Owen screamed. Looking for the source of the
                noise, Jamie looked towards her window where she saw her brother’s smiling face.</p>
