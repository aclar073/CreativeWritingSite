                <h4>Characterization</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Characterization is the representation of the traits, movtive, and psychology of a character
                        in a narrative.
                        Characterization may occur through direct description, in which the character's qualities
                        are described
                        by a narrator, another character, or by the chracter him or herself.
                        It may also occur indirectly, in which the character's qualities are
                        revealed by his or her actions, thoughts, or dialogue.
                    </p>

                </blockquote>

                <h4>Plot</strong></h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Plot is the sequence of interconnected events within the story of a play, novel, film, epic,
                        or other narrative literary work. More than simply an account of what happened, plot reveals
                        the cause-and-effect relationships between the events that occur.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>Dialogue</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Dialogue is the exchange of spoken words between two or more characters in a book, play, or
                        other written work.</p>
                </blockquote>


                <h4>Sensory Description/Imagery</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Imagery, in any sort of writing, refers to descriptive language that engages the human
                        senses.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>Point of View</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Point of view refers to the perspective that the narrator holds in relation to the events of the
                        story. The three primary points of view are first person, in which the narrator tells a story
                        from
                        their own perspective; second person, in which the narrator tells a story
                        about you, the reader or viewer; and third person, in which the narrator
                        tells a story about other people.
                    </p>
