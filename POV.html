                <p>
                    The advantage of middle-distance and far-distance third person is that instead of hearing the
                    opinions and reactions of one person, the POV character, the reader can now hear those of two
                    people: POV character and author. Distant third person lets the author put in his two-cents' worth
                    of interpretation of events.

                <blockquote class="sample">
                    <p><em>Hugh awakes to the sound of silence. It is sometime past noon, but he is unsure of the exact
                            time. He
                            no longer has deadlines or obligations. He finds life to be quite lonely. It is hard being
                            the last
                            man on earth. Even the birds have seemingly abandoned him in this world of desolation. </em>
