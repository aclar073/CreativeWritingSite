                    <h2><strong>Day 76 of Solitude</strong></h2>
                    <h5>Written by Amanda Clark</h5>
                </div>

                
                <p>Hugh awakes to the sound of silence. It is sometime past noon, but he is unsure of the exact time. He no
                longer has deadlines or obligations. He finds life to be quite lonely. It is hard being the last man on
                earth. Even the birds have seemingly abandoned him in this world of desolation.</p>

                <p>Letting out a big yawn, Hugh stretches and sits up in bed. He rubs his eyes and puts on his thick
                tortoise shell glasses. They are scratched and blurry, but he doesn’t mind.</p>

                <p>Performing his daily ritual, Hugh reaches down and shuffles through the pile of unwashed clothes. His
                hand hits the hard cover of a book. He grabs the book, straightens, and lets out another yawn. He
                doesn’t have to search for the page anymore. He quickly flips past the images of his peers, many of the
                scratched out with dark black Xs. He does not miss them.</p>

                <p>Then he sees her. Christie Halloway in her prime. She is smiling at the camera, her straight blonde hair
                blowing in the wind. She is precariously perched atop a pyramid of other girls with her arms held
                towards the sky. He remembers that night clearly, it was autumn and he had sat in the stands facing the
                cheerleaders. He was bundled in a thick winter coat. He remembers wondering if she was cold. Her bare
                legs exposed to the elements in her uniform. It left very little to the imagination and he quite enjoyed
                the view. Still deep in the memory, Hugh absently rubs his thumb over the image. He misses her dearly.</p>

                <p>Searching through the pantry, Hugh realizes it is time to restock supplies. He eyes the single can of
                pinto beans suspiciously and felt his stomach tighten in hunger. He places the can back on the empty
                shelf in disgust and begins to think of his next steps.</p>

                <p>The local grocery store was nearly a mile away and he was not expecting to make a trip today. He sighs
                and begins looking for his shoes. He finds the tattered black tennis shoes near the back door. As he
                inspects them, he notices the sole is beginning to detach at the heal. He slips them on without socks,
                opens the door, and steps into the summer heat.</p>

                <p>As he walks, he feels sweat sticking his unwashed hair to his forehead impeding his vision. He sweeps it
                back feeling the substantial knots of hair stuck to his skull. He has made this trek many times but
                continues to look towards the empty housing. He searches for any sign of change and sees none. His
                solitude is confirmed yet again.</p>

                <p>Upon reaching the grocery store, Hugh grabs a cart and begins down the aisle of staple items. He
                haphazardly throws the last boxes of Poptarts into the cart and continues down towards the snack cakes.
                Before he reaches them, the sound of a fallen box echoes through the store causing him to stop in his
                tracks. He feels his heartrate quicken and he holds his breath praying for another sound. Praying for
                another soul to be here in this desolate wasteland that was once his hometown.</p>

                <p>It is then he hears a faint curse whispered from the aisle beside him.</p>
                
                <p>“Hello?” he calls and cringes at the sound of his voice crackling with disuse. He clears his throat and
                tries again. “Whose there?”</p>
                
                <p>He hears another whispered curse in response followed by silence. Feeling a twinge of excitement, Hugh
                abandons his cart and sprints to the end of the aisle. He turns into the next aisle and stops. His heart
                is beating so loudly it is nearly deafening. He must remind himself to breathe.</p>
               
                <p>Standing among the scattered cereal boxes is a woman. Her blonde hair is tied up into a tight bun. She
                is wearing yoga pants and an exercise bra; her toned midriff is visible between the garments. Hughs eyes
                are drawn by the sparkle of her belly button ring. Forcing his eyes upwards, he sees a blush rise to her
                checks. Her expertly applied makeup still could not hide her embarrassment at being found.</p>
               
                <p>As recollection overcomes him, Hugh feels his heart beating in his throat. He has dreamed of this
                moment. He has thought of her every moment of everyday.</p>
               
                <p>“Christie?” His voice comes out a meek whisper.</p>
               
                <p>“Huburt,” She replies curtly. Her embarrassment is quickly replaced with a face of stoic resignation.</p>
               
                <p>“Christie,” He tries again, “I thought you were gone like the others. I thought I would never see you
                again.” He feels tears moisten his ruddy checks. He fights back the tears but a sniffle escapes him.
                Christie shifts her weight and glances towards the front doors of the store. She says nothing.
                “I’ve missed you so much Christie. I’ve thought about you every day. I loo – “</p>
               
                <p>“Listen Hubert,” She interrupts his monologue, “I know I said maybe if you were the last man on earth,
                but…” She leaves the sentence unfinished, allowing Hugh to figure out the rest.</p>
               
                <p>The breath he was holding suddenly comes out in an audible sigh. The tears are streaming faster now. By
                the time Hugh could regain his composure, Christie was halfway through the door, her nearly full cart
                abandoned in the littered aisle.</p>
               
                <p>“Wait!” Hugh cries and begins to chase after her. “Please don’t leave me alone!”</p>
               
                <p>By the time he reaches the door, he sees her get into a mud caked jeep and tear out of the empty parking
                lot. He chases the car out of the parking lot, but he is unable to keep up. Falling farther and farther
                behind, Hugh feels his legs go out from under him. He falls quickly with little grace. His large
                midsection takes most of the impact, knocking the breath out of him. Giving up, Hugh rolls over, and
                watches the clouds float past peacefully in complete disregard of his devastation.</p>
