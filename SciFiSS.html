                    <h2><strong>76 Days of Solitude</strong></h2>
                    <h5>Written by Amanda Clark</h5>
                </div>


                <p>Hugh awakes to the sound of silence. It is sometime past noon, but he is unsure of the exact time. He
                    no longer has deadlines or obligations. He finds life to be quite lonely. It is hard being the last
                    man on earth. Even the birds have seemingly abandoned him in this world of desolation. </p>
                <p>Letting out a big yawn, Hugh stretches and sits up in bed. He rubs his eyes and puts on his thick
                    tortoise shell glasses. They are scratched and blurry, but he doesn't mind. </p>
                <p>Performing his daily ritual, Hugh reaches down and shuffles through the pile of unwashed clothes. His
                    hand hits the hardcover of a book. He grabs the book, straightens, and lets out another yawn. He
                    doesn't have to search for the page anymore. He quickly flips past the images of his peers, many of
                    them scratched out with dark black Xs. He does not miss them. </p>
                <p>Then he sees her. Christie Halloway in her prime. She is smiling at the camera, her straight blonde
                    hair blowing in the wind. She is precariously perched atop a pyramid of other girls with her arms
                    held towards the sky. He remembers that night clearly, it was autumn and he had sat in the stands
                    facing the cheerleaders. He was bundled in a thick winter coat. He remembers wondering if she was
                    cold. Her bare legs exposed to the elements in her uniform. It left very little to the imagination
                    and he quite enjoyed the view. Still, deep in the memory, Hugh absently rubs his thumb over the
                    image. He misses her dearly. </p>
                <p>Searching through the pantry, Hugh realizes it is time to restock supplies. He eyes the single can of
                    pinto beans suspiciously and feels his stomach tighten in hunger. He places the can back on the
                    empty shelf in disgust and begins to think of his next steps. </p>
                <p>The local grocery store was nearly a mile away and he was not expecting to make a trip today. He
                    sighs and begins looking for his shoes. He finds the tattered black tennis shoes near the back door.
                    As he inspects them, he notices the sole is beginning to detach at the heel. He slips them on
                    without socks, opens the door, and steps into the summer heat. </p>
                <p>As he walks, he feels sweat sticking his unwashed hair to his forehead impeding his vision. He sweeps
                    it back feeling the substantial knots of hair stuck to his skull. He has made this trek many times
                    but continues to look towards the empty housing. He searches for any sign of change and sees none.
                    His solitude is confirmed yet again. </p>
                <p>Upon reaching the grocery store, Hugh grabs a cart and begins down the aisle of staple items. He
                    haphazardly throws the last boxes of Poptarts into the cart and continues down towards the snack
                    cakes. Before he reaches them, the sound of a fallen box echoes through the store causing him to
                    stop in his tracks. He feels his heart rate quicken and he holds his breath praying for another
                    sound. Praying for another soul to be here in this desolate wasteland that was once his hometown.
                </p>
                <p>It is then he hears a faint curse whispered from the aisle beside him. </p>
                <p>"Hello?" he calls and cringes at the sound of his voice crackling with disuse. He clears his throat
                    and tries again. "Whose there?"</p>
                <p>He hears another whispered curse in response followed by silence. Feeling a twinge of excitement,
                    Hugh abandons his cart and sprints to the end of the aisle. He turns into the next aisle and stops.
                    His heart is beating so loudly it is nearly deafening. He must remind himself to breathe.</p>
                <p>Standing among the scattered cereal boxes is a woman. Her blonde hair is tied up into a tight bun.
                    She is wearing yoga pants and an exercise bra; her toned midriff is visible between the garments.
                    Hugh's eyes are drawn by the sparkle of her belly button ring. Forcing his eyes upwards, he sees a
                    blush rise to her cheeks. Her expertly applied makeup still could not hide her embarrassment at
                    being found. </p>
                <p>As recollection overcomes him, Hugh feels his heart beating in his throat. He dreamed of this moment.
                    He has thought of her every moment of every day. </p>
                <p>"Christie?" His voice comes out a meek whisper. </p>
                <p>"Huburt," She replies curtly. Her embarrassment is quickly replaced with a face of stoic resignation.
                </p>
                <p>"Christie," He tries again, "I thought you were gone like the others. I thought I would never see you
                    again." He feels tears moisten his ruddy cheeks. He fights back the tears but a sniffle escapes him.
                </p>
                <p> Christie shifts her weight and glances towards the front doors of the store. She says nothing. </p>
                <p> "I've missed you so much, Christie. I've thought about you every day. I loo – " </p>
                <p> "Listen, Hubert," She interrupts his monologue, "I know I said maybe if you were the last man on
                    earth, but…" She leaves the sentence unfinished, allowing Hugh to figure out the rest. </p>
                <p> The breath he was holding suddenly came out in an audible sigh. The tears are streaming faster now.
                    By the time Hugh could regain his composure, Christie was halfway through the door, her nearly full
                    cart abandoned in the littered aisle. </p>
                <p> "Wait!" Hugh cries and begins to chase after her. "Please don't leave me alone!" </p>
                <p> By the time he reaches the door, he sees her get into a mud-caked jeep and tear out of the empty
                    parking lot. He chases the car out of the parking lot, but he is unable to keep up. Falling farther
                    and farther behind, Hugh feels his legs go out from under him. He falls quickly with little grace.
                    His large midsection takes most of the impact, knocking the breath out of him. Giving up, Hugh rolls
                    over and watches the clouds float past peacefully in complete disregard of his devastation. </p>

                <h3 class="title">About the Story</h3>
                <p>For this piece, I was tasked with writing in a new genre. I decided to try writing in my second
                    favorite genre which is science fiction. When it comes to science fiction, I typically read
                    books with a strong focus on science and technology. I wanted to try a different approach and
                    create a vaguely post apololypic storyline focusing on the feelings of the main character.
                    My initial inspiration for this story was the stereotypical rejection
                    "I wouldn't date you if you were the last man on earth". I always found it very commical and
                    thought it would make an interesting story.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this piece, I tried to work more on characterization. I tried to envision how the main character
                    would feel in each scene and accurately transpose that onto the page. I feel I was able to make
                    progress
                    with this technique but I do have more work to do before perfecting it.
