                <h4>Advice</h4>
                <p>If you want to highlight a particular character trait in your viewpoint character or focus on
                    something specific that the characters are talking about, you don't want the scene cluttered, the
                    reader distracted or the pace slowed by action or narrative. You know how sometimes when someone is
                    telling you a story, the setting, the other people around you, everything just kind of fades away,
                    and you're intent only on what the other person is saying? This is what it's like when you cut away
                    action and narrative and leave only your characters' spoken words.
                </p>
                <p>Pacing is probably the most common fiction element to pay attention to when considering when and when
                    not to weave dialogue, narrative, and action. If you're creating a fast-paced conflict scene between
                    two or more people, you might do well to consider only dialogue, at least for parts of it. </p>

                <h4>Use in sample text</h4>
                <p>Plot was addressed in each of my short stories. I had to address pacing to keep the story on track,
                    as well as make additional effort to properly balance the background and foreground of the story.
