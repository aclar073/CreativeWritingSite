                <h4>Advice</h4>
                <p>The sensory details you select in your writing should create for your reader the same picture you
                    have in your mind. Instead of using vague, general words, your sensory language should be concrete
                    and sensory-packed. This makes the difference between vivid and vague language.

                <h4>Sample 1</h4>
                <blockquote class="sample">
                    <p><em>Her father is sitting in his recliner in front of the television. His open
                            eyes are glassy and transfixed
                            towards the ceiling. What at first appeared to be a blanket covering him, comes into focus
                            as a
                            swarm of
                            flies. They begin to buzz around the room following the disturbance with the plate. One of
                            the flies
                            landed briefly in his eye and Jamie felt her stomach turn. It was then she saw the dried
                            blood
                            crusted
                            on his favorite jersey. His large stomach protrudes from the strained fabric . The odor is
                            unbearable.
                            She can taste the smell of decay and resists the urge to vomit. Slowly, as if detached from
                            her
                            body,
                            she closes the door. A single tear streaks down her face and she quickly wipes it away with
                            her
                            sleeve.</em></p>

                <p>This sample text addresses many of the senses including sight, sound, smell, and taste.
                    This allowed me to create a realistic and equally horrific scene.
                </p>

                <h4>Sample 2</h4>
                <blockquote class="sample">
                    <p><em>During the day, the house is quite
                            unassuming. The shutters hang haphazardly from the darkened windows. The porch
                            sags in the middle as if tired of remaining upright. There is paint peeling
                            from every exterior surface. Neighbors passed by without a second glance at the
                            overgrown yard riddled with weeds, thankful that their properties appeared
                            nicer by comparison. </em></p>

                <p>This sample only addresses the sense of sight but does so in a very descriptive way in an attempt
                    to assist readers in visualizing the neglected house.
                </p>
                <h4>Sample 3</h4>
                <blockquote class="sample">
                    <p><em>
                            This stranger was indeed strange. He
                            carried a battered leather briefcase that looked as if it were new sometime in
                            the 1950’s. In fact, everything about this man appeared to come from the
                            1950’s. He wore a pair of charcoal gray high waisted trousers, a white dress
                            shirt, and a matching charcoal gray topcoat. His light brown hair was parted to
                            the side and held in place with some form of gel. To Mr. Jones, it appeared as
                            if this man stepped out of the past and landed on his front porch. As he
                            performed his visual inspection of the stranger, he was meet with the confident
                            grin of a businessman.
                        </em></p>

                <p>The sample describes the physical appearance of an uninvited guest. I enjoyed researching 1950's
                    businessman fashion and tried to include as much detail from my research as possible.</p>
